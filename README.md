# Project Euler Solutions 🧩

Welcome to my **Project Euler Solutions** repository! This collection contains my approach to solving [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems using **Python**, focusing on **efficient algorithms, clean code, and clear explanations**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Optimized Solutions**: Each problem is solved with performance in mind.
- **Readable Code**: Solutions are written clearly with comments for understanding.
- **Algorithm Explanations**: Every problem includes a brief README explaining the approach and complexity.
- **Reusable Utilities**: Common mathematical and algorithmic functions are centralized in `utils/`.
- **Tested**: Includes basic tests to verify correctness.
